# receiptify-clone

Receiptify clone written using React.js, Python (with Flask), MongoDB, HTML, and CSS.

## introduction

In this repository I created a clone of the popular website receiptify(<https://receiptify.herokuapp.com/>)

This project aimed to further strengthen my knowledge surrounding web development and linking different frameworks, languages, and resources.

## main takeaways

The objectives of these projects were to:

* demonstrate an ability to create an online webapp that is interactive and updates to the user's inputs;
* to use RESTful APIs;
* to create my own api to connect the frontend of the website written using React.js to the backend written using Python;
* and to learn to use databases such as MongoDB;

## conclusion

This project was made in order to learn some of the basics behind using APIs in order to create an application of sorts. More details and documentation can be found at <https://mohid-tanveer.github.io/#/work>
